                    <h3>Graphic Designer<br>Part-time Gaming Enthusiast</h3>

                    <p>Born and raised in Vancouver BC, I am a very simple man, with a simple dream. To become a Graphic Designer. 
                        <br><br>
                        During my time since elementary school, I always loved to play video games and draw on my desk at school to unleash the creativity that was within my mind. Since then, I always knew that I would do something art-related as a job.
                        <br><br>
                        After finishing my two-year long journey after high-school at BCIT, taking an architecture program, I decided that Graphic Design was a better fit for me. Architecture sparked my interest, but it never aligned with my goals in life. I found myself enjoying the classes that were more hands-on, like drafting, and the ability to be entirely creative. For example, creating a house for a Nine-tailed fox as my project for my AutoCAD class! I realized that Graphic Design had the middle-ground of creativity and structure, allowing me to express innovative ideas while working within a defined framework. So this is where my journey begins and I hope you get to see it!
